### **Company:** CodTech IT Solutions

## ✅ Task Overview

As part of my DevOps internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I undertook **Task-01**, which involved a hands-on demonstration of **Git merge conflict resolution**. This task helped me understand how developers working on the same file can cause merge conflicts and how such issues are resolved professionally using Git and GitHub.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

The primary goal was to simulate a situation where two branches modify the same line of code in a file, thereby creating a merge conflict. I resolved the conflict using GitHub’s UI and ensured the repository had a clean, understandable commit history.

---

## 🔧 Steps Followed

1. **Repository Setup**  
   Created a GitHub repository named `git-merge-conflict-demo`.

2. **Branching**  
   Created two branches: `main` and `feature`.

3. **Simulating Conflict**  
   Modified the same line in `file.txt` from both branches.

4. **Pull Request**  
   Opened a pull request from `feature` to `main`.

5. **Conflict Identified**  
   GitHub detected a merge conflict due to the conflicting changes.

6. **Conflict Resolution**  
   Used GitHub’s web-based conflict editor to manually resolve the issue.

7. **Merge Completed**  
   Finalized the merge and deleted the feature branch for cleanup.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Git** – For version control, branching, and commits.  
- **GitHub** – For hosting the repository and managing pull requests.  
- **GitHub UI** – For detecting and resolving merge conflicts visually.  
- **Markdown** – For writing this README and documenting progress.

---

## 🌐 Resources Used

To ensure I thoroughly understood each step and best practices, I used multiple online resources:

- **ChatGPT** – For conceptual clarity, task breakdown, and draft assistance.  
- **Google** – For additional references on Git commands and syntax.  
- **YouTube** – For visual walkthroughs of merge conflicts and GitHub workflows.  

These platforms greatly contributed to my ability to complete the task with confidence and accuracy.

## 📘 Learning Outcome

This project taught me how version control systems like Git are used in collaborative environments. I learned how to:
- Use branching to manage features and versions,
- Simulate real-world Git conflicts,
- Use GitHub’s tools to resolve those conflicts clearly,
- Maintain a clean and professional commit history.

Understanding how to resolve merge conflicts is crucial in DevOps and software development. This task not only strengthened my practical knowledge but also boosted my confidence in handling collaborative workflows effectively.
